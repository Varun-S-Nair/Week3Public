    "\n",
    "Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are arguably the most significant biomedical advance in the last decade. Utilizing an observational case-control design, populations with disease are analytically compared to those without to discern patterns in differences in genetic variant, or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),frequencies in each of the respective populations. If statistically differences in SNP frequencies in cases vs\n",
    "controls are found, one can conclude the SNP locus may have a causal relationship, implicating a gene, genetic region, or gene regulator in the disease of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing GWASs provide lessons in observational research, including statistical association and multiple testing. They also provide a way to create hypotheses about biological basis of disease for further study. We will execute a GWAS analysis using data from the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC) on Type 2 Diabetes, Type 1 Diabetes, Bipolar Disorder, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Chron's Disease and Hypertension versus 1,500 controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There are standard tools and pipelines available to do this but we will do it the old fashioned way!\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data is provided in separate directories under the primary WTCCC directory. The subdirectories are labeled as such:\n",
    "* 58C : control population 1\n",
    "* NBS : control population 2\n",
    "* RA : rheumatoid arthritis\n",
    "* T2D : type 2 diabetes\n",
    "* T1D : type 1 diabetes\n",
    "* CAD : coronary artery disease\n",
    "* HT : hypertension\n",
    "* CD : Crohn’s disease\n",
    "* BD : bipolar disorder\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the GWAS data is broken down per chromosome, 1-22 plus X and is written into the file name, as well as the disease. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Affx_gt_ 58C _Chiamo_ 06 .tped.gz\n",
    "\n",
    "Contains GWAS data for the 6th (06) chromosome on control population 1 (58C). The biggest files are chromosome 1 and 2 and smallest is 22.\n"

    "Each row is a SNP (there are 6207 SNPs measured in Chromosome 22). The first through fourth columns denote the chromosome number, the second is the WTCCC snp_id (not to be confused with the rsid), the start coordinate (0), and the end coordinate. Thereafter, each column is a genotype (where each base is separated by a space character) for that SNP for each individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, each subdirectory also contains a ‘snps_info.tar.gz’, which contains the snp_id and rsID for each SNP for each chromosome. These files can enable you to map the WTCCC snp_id to the rsid, which is helpful to find the closest genes to a SNP (for example when you query the GWAS catalog)."
